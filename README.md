Spring Boot 2.x + Spring webflux + Mongo Reactive

* Spring Webflux - https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html
* Lombok - https://projectlombok.org/

## Lombok
I highly recommond this library, I personally think writing a **GETTER&SETTER** for every properties defined in a java POJO is waiting our priceless time, and this library can help us to do the job.

## MongoDB
To run this spring boot application, you will need to install mongodb, see spring boot mongodb configuration from https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-nosql.html#boot-features-mongodb

If you are using a Mac, I highly recommand installing MongoDB by using Homebrew, see instruction from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#install-mongodb-community-edition-with-homebrew
